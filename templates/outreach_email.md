Subject: Quick 10–20 min ask — share your tech & performance data (anonymous ok)

Hi [Name],

I'm conducting a short research project on how small businesses use digital tools and automation to scale. If you can share a few numbers (estimates are fine) for the past 12 months, I'll send you a short anonymized summary of results that may help your planning.

What I'd need:
A. Monthly revenue for the last 12 months
B. Total paid labor hours per month (or an annual total)
C. Technology tools used (comma-separated) + when adopted
D. Estimated share of processes automated (0–1)
E. Annual tech spend (subscriptions, apps)
F. Short note: biggest win / biggest frustration

Your participation is voluntary and can be anonymous. Thanks so much — happy to do a short call if easier.
